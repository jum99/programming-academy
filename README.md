    <h3>What I used to make this website:</h3>
    <p>I use react.js and react-router to build the website. I make my own json data and keep it to my public folder and then load data from it. I create some folder and
      components to make my code perfect. I make some route to my website using react-router-dom. Finally I deployed it to netlify.</p>
